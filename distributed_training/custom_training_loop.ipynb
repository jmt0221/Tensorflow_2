    "### Using iterators\n",
    "If you want to iterate over a given number of steps and not through the entire dataset you can create an iterator using the iter call and explicity call next on the iterator. You can choose to iterate over the dataset both inside and outside the tf.function. Here is a small snippet demonstrating iteration of the dataset outside the tf.function using an iterator."

    "\n",
    "We do not recommend using tf.metrics.Mean to track the training loss across different replicas, because of the loss scaling computation that is carried out.\n",

    "- Two samples are processed on each replica\n",

In this example, you end up with a total of 3.50 and count of 2, which results in total/count = 1.75 when result() is called on the metric. Loss calculated with tf.keras.Metrics is scaled by an additional factor that is equal to the number of replicas in sync."
